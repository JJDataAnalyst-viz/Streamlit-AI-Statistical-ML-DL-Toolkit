        **Jakub Jędrych**  
        Mid Data Analyst at **IQFM** | SQL, Power BI, Python, Azure, R | Data Science Enthusiast 🤖🧠🔬
        
        I am a **Data Analyst** with a strong focus on **statistical analysis** and **data science**. I specialize in leveraging **Python**, **Power BI**, and **SQL** to perform statistical tests, analyze datasets, and generate meaningful insights. 

        I continuously develop my skills in **machine learning**, **deep learning**, and **AI**, and use these tools to tackle complex data challenges, including **hypothesis testing**, **ANOVA**, **Shapiro-Wilk test**, and more. I also have a keen interest in **mathematical modeling** to understand data distributions and patterns.

        ### My expertise includes:
        - **Statistical Analysis**: T-tests, ANOVA, Shapiro-Wilk, regression models, and more.
        - **Data Analysis**: Data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and visualization using Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib).
        - **Machine Learning**: Supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms.

        I am passionate about solving problems through data, and my goal is to continuously grow and apply data-driven solutions to improve decision-making and business strategies.
