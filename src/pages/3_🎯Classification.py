st.title("Road Accident Survival Dataset")

st.write("""
### Overview:
The **Road Accident Survival Dataset** is a simulated dataset designed to analyze the impact of key factors such as age, speed, and safety measures on the survival probability during road accidents. The data provides a comprehensive view of various demographic, behavioral, and situational attributes that contribute to the outcomes of road accidents.

### Key Features:
- **Age**: The age of the individual involved in the accident. This feature helps analyze how age correlates with survival rates during a road accident.
- **Speed**: The speed at which the vehicle was traveling at the time of the accident. It provides insights into how high-speed collisions affect the likelihood of survival.
- **Safety Measures**: Whether safety measures, such as seatbelts and airbags, were used during the accident. This feature is crucial to understanding the role of safety measures in improving survival chances.
- **Demographic Information**: Includes attributes like gender, and possibly other personal details, providing an opportunity to study how different demographics influence survival outcomes.
- **Behavioral Data**: Contains data related to the individualâ€™s behavior during the accident (e.g., seatbelt use, alcohol consumption, distraction levels, etc.).
- **Accident Type**: The nature of the accident (e.g., frontal crash, side-impact, rollover), which helps correlate the severity and type of crash with survival chances.
- **Outcome**: The survival status of the individual (survived or not), which is the target variable of interest for predictive analysis.

### Objectives:
- **Analyze Survival Factors**: Investigate how age, speed, and safety measures impact survival rates.
